# React GraphQL Repository Viewer

This is a React project where I experimented with GraphQL and GitHub’s GraphQL API. The project fetches a list of repositories, paginates through them, and allows searching with dynamic query parameters. It’s part of my learning journey in front-end development with React and modern web technologies.

🚀 Features

	•	Fetch repositories using GitHub’s GraphQL API.
	•	Pagination support with Next and Previous navigation.
	•	Dynamic search functionality.
	•	User-friendly interface built with Bootstrap and Bootstrap Icons.
